      <h3>Setting up the Game</h3>
      <p>
        Spread the mat faceup on a flat surface, indoors or outdoors. Players
        take off their shoes and set them aside. If you're playing outdoors, you
        may want to anchor the mat corners with your shoes. Designate an extra
        person as the referee. The referee is not considered a player; during
        the game, the referee will spin the spinner, call out the moves, and
        monitor the game play. Position yourselves on the mat according to the
        number of players, as explained below. For a 2-player game: Players face
        each other from opposite ends of the mat, near the word Twister. Place
        one foot on the yellow circle and the other foot on the blue circle
        closest to your end of the mat. Your opponent does the same on his or
        her end. For a 3-player game: Two players face each other on opposite
        ends of the mat, near the word Twister. Each player places one foot on
        the yellow circle and the other foot on the blue circle closest to his
        or her end of the mat. The third player faces the center from the
        red-circle side of the mat, placing one foot each on the two middle red
        circles.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Play</h3>
      <p>
        The referee spins the spinner, then calls out the body part and the
        color that the arrow points to. For example, the referee may call out:
        "Right hand, red." All players, at the same time, must then try to
        follow the referee's directions as explained below.<br />
        Each player must try to place the called-out body part on a vacant
        circle of the called-out color. For [example, if the referee calls out
        "Right hand, red," each player must try to place a right hand on any
        vacant red circle. If your called-out hand or foot is already on a
        circle of the called-out color, you must try to move it to another
        circle of the same color. There can never be more than one hand or foot
        on any one circle. If two or more players reach for the same circle, the
        referee must decide which player got there first. The other player(s)
        must find another vacant circle of the same color. Never remove your
        hand or foot from a circle unless you're directed to by the referee
        after a spin. Exception: You may lift a hand or foot to allow another
        hand or foot to pass by, as long as you announce it to the referee
        beforehand, and replace it on its circle immediately afterward. If all 6
        circles of a color are already covered, the referee must spin again
        until a different color can be called out. Strategy: Try moving toward
        an opponent's portion of the mat, forcing the player to go over or under
        you to place a hand or foot!
      </p>
      <h3>Being Eliminated</h3>
      <p>
        Any player who falls, or touches the mat with an elbow or knee, is
        immediately out of the game. (If you feel that a new position is
        impossible, or will cause you to fall, you may elminiate yourself.)<br />In
        a 2-player game, the game ends and the remaining player wins. In a
        3-player game, the remaining two players keep playing until one player
        is eliminated and the remaining player wins.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Win</h3>
      <p>The last player left in the game is the winner!</p>
      <h3>Team Play</h3>
      <p>
        For a 4-player game, form 2 teams of 2 players each. Teams face each
        other on opposite ends of the mat, standing side-by-side with each foot
        on a circle so that all 4 circles closest to the Twister name are
        covered.<br />

        Just as in a 2- or 3-player game, the referee spins the spinner and
        calls out a hand or foot and a color circle. Play as in the 2- or
        3-player game, with this exception: members of the same team can cover
        the same circle with one hand or foot each.<br />

        As soon as a player falls or touches the mat with an elbow or knee, the
        player's team is eliminated and the other team is the winner.
      </p>
      <h3>2-Player Game with No Referee</h3>
      <p>
        If there are only 2 players and no referee, you can play without using
        the spinner. One player calls out the body part; the other player calls
        out the circle color. Players alternate turns calling out the body part
        first. Otherwise, game play is the same, with the last remaining player
        the winner.
      </p>
      <h3>Party Games</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Round Robin:</b> Form several 2-player teams. Each team, in turn,
        plays every other team. Players keep track of wins and losses. The team
        with the most wins wins! <br /><br />

        <b>Game:</b> Form several 2-player teams. Play against each other, with
        losing teams dropping out. Winning teams play each other until only one
        winning team is left!
